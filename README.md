# Meta Description
This is a simple version of the UNIX shell command line interpreter

# Introduction
This shell can interpret and execute command line arguments, which it reads from standard input. It can read commands from a file or from the terminal. Notably, it only executes valid commands, and displays an error otherwise.

#Usage
All files will be compiled on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine using the command: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

To run the program, use the command ./hsh

To exit, use the exit command.
